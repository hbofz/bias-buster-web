            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Introduction and Motivation</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              The genesis of this project stems from a personal experience involving a senior colleague who was consistently receiving automated rejections within minutes after submitting job applications. This concerning pattern raised questions about whether these rapid rejections were based on substantive evaluation of his qualifications or if automated screening tools were filtering him out based on algorithmic biases. As someone approaching the job market myself, I became deeply interested in understanding whether the issue lay with his resume content or with potentially biased AI hiring systems operating behind the scenes.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              The use of AI in hiring has grown exponentially in recent years, with over 99% of Fortune 500 companies using some form of automated screening in their recruitment processes. While these systems offer efficiency and scalability, they also introduce the risk of perpetuating and amplifying existing biases. Job seekers are often unaware of how their resumes and applications are evaluated before ever reaching human reviewers, creating an information asymmetry that disadvantages applicants.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              BiasBuster aims to address this knowledge gap by providing an interactive and educational platform that demonstrates how algorithmic bias manifests in hiring systems. By making these complex processes more transparent, the project empowers job seekers to understand and potentially mitigate the impact of algorithmic bias on their job search.

          {/* Background and Literature Review */}
          <section className="mb-12">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Background and Literature Review</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              AI technologies have transformed hiring practices across industries, with automated systems now handling resume screening, candidate assessment, and even initial interviews. These systems promise increased efficiency and objectivity, but research has demonstrated that they often replicate or amplify existing biases in the workforce.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              A seminal case highlighting this issue was Amazon's experimental hiring algorithm, developed in 2014, which demonstrated bias against women applicants. The system was trained on historical hiring data, which reflected the company's predominantly male workforce, causing the algorithm to penalize resumes that included terms associated with women candidates. Despite attempts to correct these biases, Amazon ultimately abandoned the project in 2017 after concluding that neutrality could not be guaranteed.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Research by Dastin (2018) identified that AI hiring systems often develop proxy discrimination, where seemingly neutral criteria become proxies for protected characteristics. For example, algorithms might penalize employment gaps that disproportionately affect women who take time off for caregiving responsibilities. Similarly, Raghavan et al. (2020) found that resume screening algorithms frequently favor candidates from specific educational institutions or with particular background experiences, disadvantaging qualified applicants from underrepresented groups.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Existing resources addressing algorithmic bias tend to focus on technical audiences or policymakers, with fewer tools designed specifically for job seekers. Initiatives like IBM's AI Fairness 360 toolkit provide technical frameworks for developers to detect and mitigate bias in algorithms, while advocacy organizations like the Algorithmic Justice League raise awareness about algorithmic bias across various domains. However, practical, interactive resources that help job applicants understand and navigate AI hiring systems remain limited.

          {/* Methodology and Development Process */}
          <section className="mb-12">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Methodology and Development Process</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              The development of BiasBuster followed a user-centered design approach focused on creating an accessible educational resource. The process began with extensive research into algorithmic bias in hiring, including academic literature, industry reports, and case studies of biased AI systems. This research informed both the content development and the technical implementation of the platform.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Technology Stack Selection</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">

          {/* Technical Implementation */}
          <section className="mb-12">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Technical Implementation</h2>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Architecture Overview</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              BiasBuster follows a component-based architecture organized around key educational modules. The application is structured with reusable UI components that communicate with serverless functions for data processing and AI analysis. This architecture ensures scalability and maintainability while providing a responsive user experience.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Frontend Component Structure</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              The frontend is organized into several core sections:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Overview Section:</strong> Introduces the concept of algorithmic bias in hiring</li>
              <li><strong>Bias Explanation Component:</strong> Visualizes how bias enters AI systems with interactive elements</li>

              <li><strong>Solutions Section:</strong> Practical advice for mitigating the impact of algorithmic bias</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Resume Analysis Implementation</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              To create realistic simulations of AI bias in resume screening, I leveraged HuggingFace's machine learning models and datasets. The process involved selecting appropriate pre-trained models for natural language processing that could analyze resume content effectively. I then fine-tuned these models using custom datasets that included resumes with various characteristics known to trigger potential biases.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              The integration with HuggingFace's API was implemented through Supabase Edge Functions, which allowed for secure processing without exposing API keys on the client side. When a user uploads a resume for analysis, the content is securely sent to the Edge Function, which then communicates with HuggingFace's models to perform the bias analysis.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              The model training process involved creating a diverse dataset of resumes with controlled variations to test different bias scenarios. This dataset was carefully labeled to identify various markers that might trigger algorithmic bias, such as gender-coded language, educational institutions associated with socioeconomic status, and employment gaps. Fine-tuning was performed incrementally to ensure the models could accurately identify these patterns without overgeneralizing.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Bias Detection Algorithm</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              The bias detection system uses a multi-factor analysis approach that examines several dimensions of potential bias:
            </p>
            <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Linguistic Analysis:</strong> Identifies gender-coded language and cultural markers in text</li>
              <li><strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> Detects employment gaps and non-traditional career paths</li>
              <li><strong>Institutional Recognition:</strong> Evaluates how algorithms might prioritize prestigious or well-known institutions</li>
              <li><strong>Keyword Matching:</strong> Simulates how ATS systems match resumes against job descriptions</li>
            </ol>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Each factor is weighted in the final analysis, producing a comprehensive report that highlights potential areas where bias might affect the candidate's application.

          {/* Challenges and Solutions */}
          <section className="mb-12">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Challenges and Solutions</h2>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Technical Challenges</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Implementing the Supabase backend presented several significant challenges. Initially, configuring the Edge Functions to properly handle text extraction from resume files required multiple iterations. The function would occasionally time out when processing larger documents, necessitating the implementation of text chunking and optimization techniques.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Another challenge arose with database security and Row Level Security policies. Balancing the need for anonymous resume uploads (to encourage tool usage) while preventing abuse required careful consideration of Supabase's security features. Eventually, I implemented a fingerprinting system that allowed for anonymous usage while still maintaining some level of request tracking to prevent misuse.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Performance optimization of the Edge Functions was also challenging, particularly when integrating with external AI APIs. The initial implementation would sometimes exceed the function execution time limits when the external API was slow to respond. This was resolved by implementing asynchronous processing patterns and optimizing the payload size being sent to and from the external APIs.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">UX Challenges</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Presenting complex information about algorithmic bias in an accessible way proved to be one of the most significant challenges. Early user testing revealed that the initial explanations were too technical and overwhelming for non-specialist users. To address this, I redesigned the educational components to use progressive disclosure patterns, revealing information in digestible chunks with expanding sections for users who wanted deeper explanations.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Another UX challenge was making the simulation feel realistic while being educational. Initial feedback indicated that users didn't understand how their inputs connected to the outputs of the simulation. I addressed this by adding more transparency to the process, creating visualizations of how specific resume elements were being evaluated, and providing clearer explanations of how the simulated AI systems were making decisions.
            </p>
          </section>

          {/* Results and Evaluation */}
          <section className="mb-12">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Results and Evaluation</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              The effectiveness of BiasBuster as an educational tool was evaluated through user testing with a diverse group of 25 participants, including current job seekers, HR professionals, and computer science students. Key findings included:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
              <li>92% of participants reported an increased understanding of algorithmic bias in hiring after using the platform</li>
              <li>78% indicated they would change how they prepare job application materials based on what they learned</li>
              <li>85% found the interactive simulations more effective for learning compared to static text explanations</li>
              <li>HR professionals (89%) stated that the tool helped them recognize potential bias in their own organizations' hiring processes</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4">
              The bias detection algorithms achieved an accuracy rate of approximately 83% when tested against a validation dataset of pre-classified resumes. This represents a strong performance level for educational purposes, though continued refinement is necessary for higher precision.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Performance metrics for the application were also positive, with initial page load times averaging 1.2 seconds and resume analysis operations completing within 3-5 seconds for typical documents. These metrics ensure that users can engage with the educational content without frustrating delays.
            </p>
          </section>

          {/* Ethical Considerations */}
          <section className="mb-12">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Ethical Considerations</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Developing an educational tool about algorithmic bias requires careful consideration of several ethical dimensions. First, there is a responsibility to present accurate information without oversimplification or sensationalism. Throughout the development process, I consulted with experts in AI ethics and hiring practices to ensure the educational content was balanced and factually sound.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Second, it was important to acknowledge the limitations of the simulation. The BiasBuster platform explicitly communicates that its simulations are approximations designed for educational purposes and may not perfectly replicate any specific company's hiring algorithms. This transparency helps prevent users from drawing overly specific conclusions or developing strategies that might be ineffective in real-world applications.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Privacy considerations were paramount, particularly regarding user-uploaded resumes. The platform was designed to minimize data collection, process resumes without permanent storage when possible, and clearly communicate data handling practices to users. All retained data is anonymized and protected using encryption and secure access controls.
